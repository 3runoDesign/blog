Oh.. the 90's. All those CRT monitors and 800px width table websites. Good ol' days when things were simple. Unfornutely, those days are over. Now we have zillions of different screen sizes and resolutions, and retina displays that are unbeliebly beautiful pixel perfect resolution -  and made every single layout you created before using images look like crap.

You probably had problems using image icons on responsive layouts before. Some of you probably solved this problem using different sizes of images for different displays ( @2x and media queries ) but the thing that really grabbed my heart when I started using was Icon Web Fonts.

As web fonts are scalable, you don't have to worry about setting different image paths for diferent devices. You just choose the font-family ( or families ) you are gonna use and that's it. Pixel perfect icons! :)

<h2>Now comes the mind-blowing tool: Fontastic</h2>

It's hard to find icon font families that actually have all the icons your are going to need in your layout, then you could have to import  another  font-tamily just to use a single icon. That's why I'm using Fontastic on all my recent projects. It's an online tool that allows you to create custom icon-font families gathering icons from diferent families and even uploading your own to create a custom set. 

<h2>How to use Fontastic:</h2> 

1 - First of all, you need to creat an account. It's free don't worry: http://fontastic.me/
2 - Now just choose the icons you are going to use. Click on them to select any icon you whant from any font-family available.
3 -  Now go to the Download tab and follow the instructions to download or publish your font on Amazon S3. A few copy and pastes and you are ready to go.
