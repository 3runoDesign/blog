Who do you know that is willing to acknowledge failure and memorize it? When have you last reflected about the costs of failing? 

As we build products and retrospect about improvements, our thoughts lead to decisions that can vary from negative to just outright weird. As a creator, remember you cannot develop the right product for your client if you fall in love with a prototype that nobody wants to buy. That’s common but wrong way to fail. Don’t worry about building a perfect app, or the perfect design, or having the perfect process. Just improve these and other aspects of your project continuously. But know this: reading this post will not be enough. We need to constantly dig deeper and reason why.

Get your inner ideas about failures out of limbo.

Do it alone by following the exercise below, or find someone who you trust to retrospect with you for a day about your project, and then wait. After you digest it, you’ll have new ideas. Go on, reflect. Do not be afraid to think about those costly project expenses you had, or the bad or embarrassing moments you’ve put yourself through during your product development journey.

If you're doing this right, you should be thinking about things that didn't turn out exactly how you've expected. Constantly ask yourself how much did it cost you to fail.

If you find that you’re penalizing yourself too much for personal failings and stupid negative thoughts start to roam around, that’s ok. Classify and memorize these failings. I strongly believe that being willing to look in the mirror and recognize this stuff is very important for becoming a better change-maker, a better creator and entrepreneur (a better human being). There is probably no better way to safely ignore stupid thoughts than to intentionally expose our mistakes to friends and coworkers, it serves as a mechanism so that failures don’t just jump to, or stay in limbo. This type of stuff happens all the time when we work collectively as well, that’s the origin of retrospective meetings at work. If our intentions are good and we’re truly passionate about improving what’s around us, than stressing about unhealthy thoughts ruling the mind is not necessary. That’s when you know you need to retrospect with a friend or a coworker. I don’t know about you, but I would rather expose them and take the “I-care-where-this-leads-me-years-from-now” path. Ignoring personal failures is a time bomb, so find any hidden weaknesses and expose them now.

## Exercise (do this with someone else, biweekly): 

Before you start, remember, you cannot expect to grow your product without failing. It may be necessary to step back so you can take two steps forward.

If it’s the first time you’re doing this: forget about the obvious stuff you know you should be doing but are not (read: customer development), like reaching out to current customers and writing a simple interview script to get their feedback via a 5-minute Skype call. Also, forget about new or exiting features for a second. 

- Write or explain to someone, in general terms, how it's been like to develop your product so far? Don't be afraid in case things slip off your mind, just write them down later as they come to you.

- In a few words using Post-it, write down any of the moments, actions or events that relates to failures in your journey. You should be writing down good things, and things that need improvement. Use your gut and start thinking about solutions for breaking it down.

- Present the Post-its to a friend, a coworker, or a co-founder, or personally review each Post-it out loud. If there’s a fix or a new belief, present it quickly.

- Review all the Post-its that need improvement. 

- Define final action-items, new principles or new methods, and respect it. Test it 14 days.

Producing good ideas requires that we do intellectual work. The method of retrospection can simplify. But if you need a little motivation to get this stuff going, do it with someone else that’s also invested in your project. Take a stab at it.
